To run a nginx+uwsgi+flask web server, just run command:
#nginx
#uwsgi testserver.ini
or
#uwsgi runserver.ini
Be sure of your Flask project was correct configured as the requires in this document.


Then you can visit http://server-machine-ip:80/test
Note that you need to map a host port to container's 80 port


To specify nginx http port, just edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf Line 12
default port is modified to 80

If you want run with your own Flask project, just using 
sudo docker -v yourFlaskPrjPath:/root/webroot
and make sure that your entry py file is named to ‚Äùmain.py"
and the app object is named to "app" 

### run example
sudo docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 9999:80 -v yourFlaskPrjPath:/root/webroot --device /dev/nvidiactl --device /dev/nvidia-uvm --device /dev/nvidia0 joe8767/web-mxnet-gpu

Explanation of testserver.ini
# uwsgi socket ip
socket = 127.0.0.1:3031
# Your Flask app location
chdir=./WebApp/
# Your Flask app filename
wsgi-file=Example.py
# Your Flask app Object name (such as "app = Flask(__name__)")
callable=app
